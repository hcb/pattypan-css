# pattypan css

pattypan-css is a amalgamation of different CSS frameworks/libraries/boilerplate I've liked over the years, primarily [Skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton) (this uses many of the same class names as Skeleton), as well as [Flexbox Grid](https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid) and [Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) to a lesser extent. I use this as a starter for my personal projects.

The name 'pattypan css' came from another old project of mine: [namurjsâ†—](https://www.cakehat.com/namurjs). It sounded fitting since this is supposed to be small and kinda cute.
